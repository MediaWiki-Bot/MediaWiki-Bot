Revision history for MediaWiki::Bot
===================================

Vers. Rel.Mgr. SVN  Date
------------------------
3.1.2 Mike.lif r332 07 June 2010
    Changes made since 3.1.1
        * Setting a useragent now works
3.1.1 Mike.lif r318 06 June 2010
    Changes made since 3.1.0
        * Some cached data in now invalidated when set_wiki() is called
3.1.0 Mike.lif r302 05 June 2010
    Changes made since 3.0.0
        * BREAKING CHANGE: update_rc() now accepts a hashref of options, and the hash structure returned is changed. See POD for details.
        * get_pages_in_category() and get_all_pages_in_category() now work properly for non-English wikis (issue 42).
        * Moving pages is now supported (issue 43).
        * diff() now supports basic diffing.
        * prefixindex() now supports listing pages with a common prefix
        * edit() can now do section editing.
        * Another alias was added: perlwikipedia
        * Searching is now supported by search()
        * Methods like linksearch(), get_pages_in_category(), and list_transcludes() now perform only one query by default. Pass max => 5 (or whatever)
          to do more queries. Note that this controls the number of queries, not the number of results fetched per query. See POD for details

3.0.0 Mike.lif r282 30 May 2010
    Changes made since 2.3.0
        * BREAKING CHANGE: get_text() now returns the page's wikitext. Blank pages return ""; nonexistent pages return undef.
          These both evaluate to false; you can differentiate between them with defined(). get_id() now returns undef instead of
          2 when there is no pageid (page is nonexistent or title is invalid).
        * BREAKING CHANGE: All subs return undef when they encounter an error that is passed off to _handle_api_error(). Error
          details are still available in $bot->{'error'}.
        * BREAKING CHANGE: linksearch() now uses keys 'url' and 'title' like the API does. This is to avoid confusion when using
          a callback hook, which is now exposed to callers. linksearch() now uses the API.
        * BREAKING CHANGE: login()'s return values are reversed, and properly documented. Returns true for success; false for failure:
          $bot->login($user, $pass) or die "Login failed\n"; # This is in accord with Perl standards
        * BREAKING CHANGE: what_links_here() no longer handles transclusions. To get transclusions, use list_transclusions(). Also,
          key names are now 'title' and 'redirect' (defined when the page is a redirect; undefined otherwise).
        * Codebase underwent spring cleaning.
        * Default useragent now includes the version number.
        * Functionality which still uses index.php no longer fails on non-English wikis. Patch by piotr.kubowicz.
        * Crypt::SSLeay is now correctly listed as a prerequisite,
        * is_blocked() replaces test_blocked(), and now uses the API. test_blocked() remains for backwards compatibility,
        * was_blocked() replaces test_block_hist(), and now uses the API. test_block_hist() remains for backwards compatibility.
        * $summary is now optional for undelete(); a generic reason will be used if ommitted. undelete() also uses API now.
        * edit() now uses an md5 hash to ensure data integrity.
        * set_highlimits() can now be used to *not* use highlimits.
        * revert() now uses the API.
        * get_last() now uses the API.
        * undo() now uses the API, and is documented accurately.
        * logout() was added.
        * purge_page() now uses the API and returns the number of pages successfully purged, which may be useful for the caller's error-checking.
        * New methods were added to query WMF's sitematrix, and convert between db name (enwikibooks) to the domain name (en.wikibooks.org):
          db_to_domain() and domain_to_db().
        * Admin functions were moved into the plugin MediaWiki::Bot::Plugin::Admin, which is auto-loaded if present.
        * The constructor now does more for script authors. It sets the wiki, logs in, and does some autoconfiguration. See updated POD for details.
        * edit() now accepts a hashref of options. See updated POD for details.
        * expandtemplates() now uses the API.

2.3.0 DCOLLINS r206 June 23 2009
    Changes made since 2.2.3
        * Get_pages now makes sense when following namespace aliases. The title you give is the title you get back. Aliases are not expanded. Patch by
          Stefan Petrea.
        * Unicode test will now take a bit longer but hopefully avoid any errors that shouldn't be there

2.2.3 DCOLLINS r195 May 5 2009
    Changes made since 2.1.1
        * RELEASE-NOTES renamed to Changes
        * Test suite now outputs a message when there is an expected error to be printed to terminal
        * Some debugging code removed
        * Simplify Unicode tests, now only run editing tests if not blocked
        * More specific error detection in test 11 (get_pages_in_namespace)
        * More verbose error handling in all code
        * Add unblock capability

2.1.1 DCOLLINS r184 February 24 2009
    Changes made since 2.1.0
        * Additions of sub unblock, some test changes
    Notes
        * Error checking is about to be updated. If an error occurs, any subs will return -1*the integer error number. See the updated documentation in
          2.2.0.

2.1.0 DCOLLINS r184 February 3 2009
    Changes made since 2.0.1
        * Some more unicode changes
        * If unicode doesn't work, TELL ME

2.0.1 DCOLLINS r181 January 26 2009
    Changes made since 2.0.0
        * Removed some redundant error messages

2.0.0 DCOLLINS r179 December 30 2008
    Changes made since 1.5.2:
        * I was going to make this 1.5.3, but then I realized I shouldn't hide something this big behind a sub-minor release. For reasons of having the
          module included in the module list on CPAN, making everything be a bit neater, and for all-around happiness, I've moved Perlwikipedia into
          the preexisting MediaWiki:: namespace. The module is now called MediaWiki::Bot.
        * You can also now use "PWP" instead of "MediaWiki::Bot" in your code. The distribution on CPAN and in the svn repo includes an alias.
        * Plugins are now loaded automatically if installed. This means you don't have to do as much arcane magic. The plugins will be listed under
          MediaWiki::Bot::Plugin:: in CPAN and are not currently in svn. If you have a task that you would like to make into a plugin and publish on
          CPAN, please get in touch with me at DCOLLINS@cpan.org
    Plugin notes since the last release:
        * Added the ImageTester plugin to CPAN. Purpose is to analyze and tag copyrighted images which do not follow en.wikipedia's policies
        * Added the CUP plugin to CPAN as a basic example of what a plugin does. This is used by the bot that will run the WikiCup stats, and these
          methods can be called just like any other methods in the main module

1.5.2 DCOLLINS r178 December 27 2008
    Changes made since 1.5.1:
        * Add support for 'plugins' which add additional features to MediaWiki::Bot. See MediaWiki::Bot::Plugin::ImageTester on CPAN for an example.
        * Loosened requirements for test_image_exists to determine that an image is on commons: the missing key is not always present.

1.5.1 DCOLLINS r173 December 21 2008
    Changes made since 1.5.0:
        * Fixed the bug where logins wouldn't transfer from API to wiki again, now part of test 01.
        * Added tests for AssertEdit, maxlag, get_allusers, get_pages
        * Added sub set_highlimits for api queries, since PWP can't tell if you're a bot
        * Sub test_image_exists can now tell if an image page exists but has no image. Also uses API.
        * Added defaults for protection, now uses API. In-house tests exist for protection and deletion.
        * Some variable normalizing in tests.
        * Added testing environment variables: PWPMakeTestSetWikiHost, PWPMakeTestSetWikiDir
        * Reenabled tests for get_namespace_names, get_pages_in_namespace
        * Some fixes for potential race conditions on database replication for tests, should not be necessary in real production code

1.5.0 DCOLLINS r164 December 08 2008
    Changes made since 1.4.2:
        * Added a sub get_pages(), which accepts a list of pages and gets each page's text in one go and returns a hash. Much faster than get_text()
          for more than one page.
        * Switched sub protect over to API, cascading works now
        * Add a few more tests

1.4.2 DCOLLINS December 07 2008
    Changes made since 1.4.1:
        * Apparently I accidentally removed get_allusers? Fixed that.
        * Some CPAN testers have been reporting a failure to make the test edit in t/02_edit.t so I added a call to Data::Dumper.

1.4.1 DCOLLINS November 27 2008
    Changes made since 1.4.0:
        * Remove my tsting code from sub login, now using an updated version of MediaWiki::API to handle cookies properly. MediaWiki::API 0.20 or
          higher now required.

1.4.0 DCOLLINS November 18 2008
    Changes made since 1.3.8:
        * Fix a bug in get_allusers() by bosborne
        * Fix a bug which made some methods, such as delete_old_image, attempt to execute logged-out because the method used to transfer cookies from
          the API useragent, which does the logging in, to the MediaWiki::Bot useragent, which does the other stuff, was not functional. This bug
          only affected non-api methods and has been fixed through a nasty hack, which I hope can be made cleaner in the coming weeks.

1.3.8 DCOLLINS November 16 2008
    Changes made since 1.3.7:
        * New method: get_allusers($limit) by bosborne
        * That bug I fixed in 1.3.7? I fixed it again. For real this time.
        * Using 'retries' instead of 'max retries' config variable for MediaWiki::API HTTP errors

1.3.7 DCOLLINS November 11 2008
    Changes made since 1.3.6:
        * Minor bugfix in one of the tests.

1.3.6 DCOLLINS October 27 2008
    Changes made since 1.3.5:
        * Added maxlag compatibility. (Thanks to the developers of MediaWiki::API for their implementation) The settings are as follows:
            * Maxlag parameter: Dafault 5 seconds, can be configured when creating the object
            * Delay: 1 second
            * Retries: Until success
        * Make test 98 fail gracefully on platforms without the test suite
        * Fix some really weird spacing in the Makefile.PL
    Notes:
        * The other maxlag options, along with lots of other defaults, will probably be modifiable in 1.4 with a sort of config sub. This will allow
          the custom configuration of options for WWW::Mechanize and MediaWiki::API, so you don't need to go sourcediving or remember the order for the
          parameters to the constructor.
        * Since wiki.xyrael.net is down, tests 1, 8, 10, 11

1.3.5 DCOLLINS October 4 2008
    Changes made since 1.3.4:
        * Allowing cascade protection now. This may or may not work, since there are some changes being made to the protection API.
        * Anonymous editing should work. If you still can not use this framework to edit, I need to be contacted. To this end, I've enabled an editing
          test, hopefully cpan-testers sends me good results :)
        * Fix a stupid mistake I made regarding the names of certain parameters to get_history

1.3.4 DCOLLINS September 11 2008
    Changes made since 1.3.3:
        * Some triage after the first CPAN test results came in:
        * Appearantly, get_pages_in_category was running test file 08, test 2, very slowly because I was loading a 1000+ page category in sets of 10
          pages at a time. This has been remedied, the limit is now 500.
        * Cannot reproduce a bug in get_namespace_names and another in count_contributions - so instead, if we get weird results, we run the sub again.
        * There is a bug in get_history which was causing weird errors on some test machines. I've switched it to use MediaWiki::API.

1.3.3 DCOLLINS September 10 2008
    Changes made since 1.3.2:
        * get_pages_in_category now uses the API
        * Test 8 has been modified to test nested categories
        * Test 7 is now faster, but still effective
        * Bug checking added on edit for anon edit bug
        * Bots now use the bot flag when editing, as was done before switching to API editing
    Notes:
        * Regarding anonymous editing: MediaWiki bug 15420 has been marked as FIXED by Roan Kattouw. Waiting for that to be scapped so I can test it
          and enable the editing tests.
        * Before I updated get_pages_in_category, it seemed to have some encoding errors: returning escape sequences where it shouldn't. I'll be
          looking into its status on that front.

1.3.2 DCOLLINS August 30 2008
    Changes made since 1.3.1:
        * Now logging in via API if password is supplied
    Bugs fixed since 1.3.1:
        * Fixed an encoding issue in page saving
    Notes:
        * Anonymous editing is currently broken. This is an upstream issue which I am working to resolve

1.3.1 DCOLLINS August 28 2008
    Changes made since 1.3:
        * Maintenance: update manifest, readme
        * More MediaWiki::API: blocking, deleting, get_text
        * Add localization for MediaWiki::API. This is important...
        * Update tests to test for loading of sections of pages
        * AssertEdit assertaions can now be passed as 'bot' OR as '&assert=bot'
    Bugs fixed since 1.3:
        * MediaWiki::API didn't localise with set_wiki()
        * Unicode issues with MediaWiki::API editing fixed
        * Fix one warning in edit() - undefined value in string eq near line 252

1.3 DCOLLINS August 2008
    Changes made since 1.2:
        * Convert over to use MediaWiki::API

1.01
    Changes made since 1.0:
        * Standardized all functions to return 1 and set $object->{errstr} in the event of an error
    Bugs fixed since 1.0:
        * get_history and other _get_api-based functions will now properly escape utf8 characters in the query
        * Fixed memory leak issues with WWW::Mechanize

0.1  Sat Aug 25 2007
    * original version
