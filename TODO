*sub edit
**Unicode is tested by t_21, but only for the article text. Can we test it for edit summaries as well? How about usernames in the editing history? Add tests to ./t/t_21
**Figure out how bot flag handling works. Bot flags should be enabled by default - or maybe a configuration setting like $self->{highlimits}??
*sub get_history
**Unicode handling?
*sub get_pages
**Does not handle things like "WP:TEST" correctly - it returns a hashkey of Wikipedia:TEST but not WP:TEST. (TODO test in t_18)
**Does not handle more pages than are allowed automatically be running multiple queries using highlimits like get_pages_in_namespace does

*New features
**At some point I want to make a "Common Tasks" plugin...
**Are all admin functions available?
**Allow the patrolling of articles
**Allow the checking of whether an article is patrolled
**Allow the listing of new articles, make sure sub update_rc is fully configurable
