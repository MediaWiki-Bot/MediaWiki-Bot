./lib/MediaWiki/Bot.pm
*sub _get_api
**Make sure this sub is unused. If it is, remove it. If not, make it unused.
*sub login
**Find out whether saving the cookies still works anymore. The script login.pl should save cookies. sub login should load them if called without a password. The result should be logged in to both the API and the wiki. If loading the cookies doesn't work, either make it work, or if not possible, remove it.
*sub edit
**Unicode is tested by t_21, but only for the article text. Can we test it for edit summaries as well? How about usernames in the editing history? Add tests to ./t/t_21
**Figure out how bot flag handling works. Bot flags should be enabled by default - or maybe a configuration setting like $self->{highlimits}??
*sub get_history
**Unicode handling?
*sub get_pages
**Does not handle things like "WP:TEST" correctly - it returns a hashkey of Wikipedia:TEST but not WP:TEST. (TODO test in t_18)
**Does not handle more pages than are allowed automatically be running multiple queries using highlimits like get_pages_in_namespace does
*sub get_pages_in_category
**Does not handle more pages than are allowed automatically be running multiple queries using highlimits like get_pages_in_namespace does
**Rewrite tests using the english wikipedia


*New features
**At some point I want to make a "Common Tasks" plugin...
**Are all admin functions available?
**Allow the patrolling of articles
**Allow the checking of whether an article is patrolled
**Allow the listing of new articles, make sure sub update_rc is fully configurable
