MediaWiki::Bot is very easy to install. If you have the prerequisites installed, just run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test (optional, the module should work right out of the box)
    make install

That's it! The man page is available by doing "man MediaWiki::Bot"

To get the prerequisites, we recommend using the CPAN shell. The list of prerequisites is in Makefile.PL.

user@host:~$ sudo -i
root@host:~# cpan
cpan> install MediaWiki::API
...
cpan> install WWW:Mechanize
... and so on...
