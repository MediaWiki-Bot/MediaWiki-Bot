MediaWiki::Bot version 3.1.0
============================

This is MediaWiki::Bot, a Perl module designed to interface with wikis using
the MediaWiki wiki software like popular online encyclopedia project Wikipedia.

SUPPORT
-------

First, check the online documentation. If your question is not answered there,
you can contact the development team in three ways, listed here from most to
least preferred:

 1. Email perlwikibot@googlegroups.com
 2. Submit a bug to http://perlwikipedia.googlecode.com
 3. Join #perlwikipedia on irc.freenode.net

INSTALLATION
------------

There are two ways to install this. If you use the CPAN shell to install
MediaWiki::Bot, the entire process is automated:

    user@host:~$ sudo -i
    root@host:~# cpan
    cpan> install MediaWiki::Bot
    ...

You might have CPAN configured such that you don't need to become root
initially.

Otherwise, you can install it manually. First install the dependencies (listed
below), then install MediaWiki::Bot. To install this module type the following
in the root directory:

   user@host:~$ perl Makefile.PL
   user@host:~$ make
   user@host:~$ make test
   user@host:~$ sudo make install

You might use other methods to become root instead of sudo.

The test scripts included with this distribution of MediaWiki::Bot
require a working internet connection. If the test suite fails,
it might be safe to install the module anyway. When in doubt,
email perlwikibot@googlegroups.com with the complete output of the
test suite and ask for advice.
