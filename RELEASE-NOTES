Revision history for Perlwikipedia

1.3.6 October 27 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.5:
		* Added maxlag compatibility. (Thanks to the developers of MediaWiki::API for their implementation) The settings are as follows:
			* Maxlag parameter: Dafault 5 seconds, can be configured when creating the object
			* Delay: 1 second
			* Retries: Until success
		* Make test 98 fail gracefully on platforms without the test suite
		* Fix some really weird spacing in the Makefile.PL
	Notes:
		* The other maxlag options, along with lots of other defaults, will probably be modifiable in 1.4 with a sort of config sub. This will allow the custom configuration of options for WWW::Mechanize and MediaWiki::API, so you don't need to go sourcediving or remember the order for the parameters to the constructor.
		* Since wiki.xyrael.net is down, tests 1, 8, 10, 11
1.3.5 October 4 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.4:
		* Allowing cascade protection now. This may or may not work, since there are some changes being made to the protection API.
		* Anonymous editing should work. If you still can not use this framework to edit, I need to be contacted. To this end, I've enabled an editing test, hopefully cpan-testers sends me good results :)
		* Fix a stupid mistake I made regarding the names of certain parameters to get_history
1.3.4 September 11 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.3:
		* Some triage after the first CPAN test results came in:
		* Appearantly, get_pages_in_category was running test file 08, test 2, very slowly because I was loading a 1000+ page category in sets of 10 pages at a time. This has been remedied, the limit is now 500.
		* Cannot reproduce a bug in get_namespace_names and another in count_contributions - so instead, if we get weird results, we run the sub again.
		* There is a bug in get_history which was causing weird errors on some test machines. I've switched it to use MediaWiki::API.
1.3.3 September 10 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.2:
		* get_pages_in_category now uses the API
		* Test 8 has been modified to test nested categories
		* Test 7 is now faster, but still effective
		* Bug checking added on edit for anon edit bug
		* Bots now use the bot flag when editing, as was done before switching to API editing
	Notes:
		* Regarding anonymous editing: MediaWiki bug 15420 has been marked as FIXED by Roan Kattouw. Waiting for that to be scapped so I can test it and enable the editing tests.
		* Before I updated get_pages_in_category, it seemed to have some encoding errors: returning escape sequences where it shouldn't. I'll be looking into its status on that front.
1.3.2 August 30 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.1:
		* Now logging in via API if password is supplied
	Bugs fixed since 1.3.1:
		* Fixed an encoding issue in page saving

	Changes made since 1.3:
		* Maintenance: update manifest, readme
		* More MediaWiki::API: blocking, deleting, get_text

		* Update tests to test for loading of sections of pages
		* AssertEdit assertaions can now be passed as 'bot' OR as '&assert=bot'
	Bugs fixed since 1.3:
		* MediaWiki::API didn't localise with set_wiki()
		* Unicode issues with MediaWiki::API editing fixed
		* Fix one warning in edit() - undefined value in string eq near line 252
