Revision history for Perlwikipedia

1.4.0 DCOLLINS November 18 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.8:
		* Fix a bug in get_allusers() by bosborne
		* Fix a bug which made some methods, such as delete_old_image, attempt to execute logged-out because the method used to transfer cookies from the API useragent, which does the logging in, to the Perlwikipedia useragent, which does the other stuff, was not functional. This bug only affected non-api methods and has been fixed through a nasty hack, which I hope can be made cleaner in the coming weeks.
1.3.8 DCOLLINS November 16 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.7:
		* New method: get_allusers($limit) by bosborne
		* That bug I fixed in 1.3.7? I fixed it again. For real this time.
		* Using 'retries' instead of 'max retries' config variable for MediaWiki::API HTTP errors
1.3.7 DCOLLINS November 11 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.6:
		* Minor bugfix in one of the tests.
1.3.6 DCOLLINS October 27 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.5:
		* Added maxlag compatibility. (Thanks to the developers of MediaWiki::API for their implementation) The settings are as follows:
			* Maxlag parameter: Dafault 5 seconds, can be configured when creating the object
			* Delay: 1 second
			* Retries: Until success
		* Make test 98 fail gracefully on platforms without the test suite
		* Fix some really weird spacing in the Makefile.PL
	Notes:
		* The other maxlag options, along with lots of other defaults, will probably be modifiable in 1.4 with a sort of config sub. This will allow the custom configuration of options for WWW::Mechanize and MediaWiki::API, so you don't need to go sourcediving or remember the order for the parameters to the constructor.
		* Since wiki.xyrael.net is down, tests 1, 8, 10, 11
1.3.5 DCOLLINS October 4 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.4:
		* Allowing cascade protection now. This may or may not work, since there are some changes being made to the protection API.
		* Anonymous editing should work. If you still can not use this framework to edit, I need to be contacted. To this end, I've enabled an editing test, hopefully cpan-testers sends me good results :)
		* Fix a stupid mistake I made regarding the names of certain parameters to get_history
1.3.4 DCOLLINS September 11 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.3:
		* Some triage after the first CPAN test results came in:
		* Appearantly, get_pages_in_category was running test file 08, test 2, very slowly because I was loading a 1000+ page category in sets of 10 pages at a time. This has been remedied, the limit is now 500.
		* Cannot reproduce a bug in get_namespace_names and another in count_contributions - so instead, if we get weird results, we run the sub again.
		* There is a bug in get_history which was causing weird errors on some test machines. I've switched it to use MediaWiki::API.
1.3.3 DCOLLINS September 10 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.2:
		* get_pages_in_category now uses the API
		* Test 8 has been modified to test nested categories
		* Test 7 is now faster, but still effective
		* Bug checking added on edit for anon edit bug
		* Bots now use the bot flag when editing, as was done before switching to API editing
	Notes:
		* Regarding anonymous editing: MediaWiki bug 15420 has been marked as FIXED by Roan Kattouw. Waiting for that to be scapped so I can test it and enable the editing tests.
		* Before I updated get_pages_in_category, it seemed to have some encoding errors: returning escape sequences where it shouldn't. I'll be looking into its status on that front.
1.3.2 DCOLLINS August 30 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.1:
		* Now logging in via API if password is supplied
	Bugs fixed since 1.3.1:
		* Fixed an encoding issue in page saving
	Notes:
		* Anonymous editing is currently broken. This is an upstream issue which I am working to resolve
1.3.1 DCOLLINS August 28 2008
	Changes made since 1.3:
		* Maintenance: update manifest, readme
		* More MediaWiki::API: blocking, deleting, get_text
		* Add localization for MediaWiki::API. This is important...
		* Update tests to test for loading of sections of pages
		* AssertEdit assertaions can now be passed as 'bot' OR as '&assert=bot'
	Bugs fixed since 1.3:
		* MediaWiki::API didn't localise with set_wiki()
		* Unicode issues with MediaWiki::API editing fixed
		* Fix one warning in edit() - undefined value in string eq near line 252
