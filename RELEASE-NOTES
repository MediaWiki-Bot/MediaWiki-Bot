Revision history for Perlwikipedia

1.3.3 September 10 2008
	Changes made since 1.3.2:
		* get_pages_in_category now uses the API
		* Test 8 has been modified to test nested categories
		* Test 7 is now faster, but still effective
		* Bug checking added on edit for anon edit bug
		* Bots now use the bot flag when editing, as was done before switching to API editing
	Notes:
		* Regarding anonymous editing: MediaWiki bug 15420 has been marked as FIXED by Roan Kattouw. Waiting for that to be scapped so I can test it and enable the editing tests.
		* Before I updated get_pages_in_category, it seemed to have some encoding errors: returning escape sequences where it shouldn't. I'll be looking into its status on that front.
